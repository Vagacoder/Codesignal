# * Core 50, Crossword Formation
# * Medium

# * ou're a crossword fanatic, and have finally decided to try and create your 
# * own. However, you also love symmetry and good design, so you come up with a 
# * set of rules they should follow:

#     the crossword must contain exactly four words;
#     these four words should form four pairwise intersections;
#     all words must be written either left-to-right or top-to-bottom;
#     the area of the rectangle formed by empty cells inside the intersections 
#       isn't equal to zero.

# Given 4 words, find the number of ways to make a crossword following the above-
# described rules. Note that two crosswords which differ by rotation are considered 
# different.

# * Example

# For words = ["crossword", "square", "formation", "something"], the output should be
# crosswordFormation(words) = 6.

# The six crosswords can be formed as shown below:

#   f                         f                             f
#   o                     c r o s s w o r d     c r o s s w o r d
