# * Core 69. House of Cats
# * Medium

# * There are some people and cats in a house. You are given the number of legs 
# * they have all together. Your task is to return an array containing every possible 
# * number of people that could be in the house sorted in ascending order. It's 
# * guaranteed that each person has 2 legs and each cat has 4 legs.

# * Example

#     For legs = 6, the output should be
#     houseOfCats(legs) = [1, 3].

#     There could be either 1 cat and 1 person (4 + 2 = 6) or 3 people (2 * 3 = 6).

#     For legs = 2, the output should be
#     houseOfCats(legs) = [1].

#     There can be only 1 person.

# * Input/Output

#     [execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

#     [input] integer legs
#     The total number of legs in the house. It's guaranteed,that this number is even.

#     Guaranteed constraints:
#     0 â‰¤ legs < 50.

#     [output] array.integer
#     Every possible number of people that can be in the house.

# * Solution 1
def houseOfCats(legs: int)-> list:
    result = []
    for i in range(legs//2 + 1):    
        if (legs - i * 2)%4 == 0:
            result.append(i)
    
    return result


# * Solution 2
def houseOfCats2(legs: int)-> list:
    return [x for x in range(legs//2 + 1) if (legs-x*2)%4 == 0]

a1 = 6
r1 = houseOfCats2(a1)
print(r1)
