# * Intro 02, Century From Year
# * Given a year, return the century it is in. The first century spans from the 
# * year 1 up to and including the year 100, the second - from the year 101 up to 
# * and including the year 200, etc.
# * 
# * Example
# *
# *  For year = 1905, the output should be
# *  centuryFromYear(year) = 20;
# *  For year = 1700, the output should be
#  *  centuryFromYear(year) = 17.
#  * 
#  * Input/Output

#  *  [execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)

#  *  [input] integer year

#  *  A positive integer, designating the year.

#  *  Guaranteed constraints:
#  *  1 â‰¤ year â‰¤ 2005.

#  *  [output] integer

#  *  The number of the century the year is in.
